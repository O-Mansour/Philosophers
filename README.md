# PHILOSOPHERS
- Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.
- It simulates a classic problem in computer science: the Dining Philosophers problem, which highlights issues of resource allocation and deadlock.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a simulation of philosophers sitting at a table, where they alternately think and eat spaghetti.
The challenge lies in managing their access to limited resources (forks) without causing deadlocks or resource starvation.
